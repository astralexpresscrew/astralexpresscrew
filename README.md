✦ Astral.Express.Crew ☆ 15+ int pref.
the/sketchspace in most media + barely active on ponytown .
Read our Patreon because it has most info/ask for discord and whatnot

✦ we like to draw and we'd love to meet more systems on here. open to interaction and would love to see sourcemates/have them interact with us

✦ we don't usually approach first. **whisper to interact** as well since we might not see your messages!
