the/sketchspace in most media + barely active on ponytown .
Read our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/astralexpresscrew) or [Carrd](https://noctuaaudacemamat.carrd.co) because it has most info/ask for discord and whatnot
we'll probably figure this out and redo it some other day

✦ we like to draw and we'd love to meet more systems on here. open to interaction and would love to see sourcemates/have them interact with us

✦ we don't usually approach first. **whisper to interact** as well since we might not see your messages!
Some of what we do:
